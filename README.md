## üõ† Technical Architecture

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python web framework)
- **AI Engine**: Cohere LLM (command-r-plus model)
- **Backend**: Python 3.10+
-

### **Core Libraries**
- `streamlit`: Web application framework and UI components
- `cohere`: LLM integration for intelligent question generation
- `re`: Regular expression parsing for question extraction
- `datetime`: Timestamp generation and formatting
- `os`: Environment variable management

### **Application Flow**
```
User Input ‚Üí Streamlit Form ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí 
Cohere API ‚Üí Question Generation ‚Üí 
Session State Management ‚Üí Q&A Loop ‚Üí 
```

### **State Management**
The application uses Streamlit's session state to maintain:
- `candidate_info`: Personal and professional details
- `questions`: Generated interview questions list
- `answers`: Complete Q&A pairs with metadata
- `current_question`: Interview progress tracking
- `interview_started`: Application flow control
- `interview_completed`: Summary display trigger

## üéØ AI Prompt Design

### **Question Generation Strategy**
The system sends carefully crafted prompts to Cohere that include:

```python
prompt = f"""
You are an expert technical recruiter. Generate exactly 5 focused technical interview questions for a candidate with the following tech stack: {tech_stack}

Rules:
1. Generate EXACTLY 5 questions, no more, no less
2. Cover the most important and commonly used technologies first
3. Make questions practical and relevant to real-world scenarios
4. Vary difficulty from basic to intermediate
5. Each question should be clear and concise
6. Format as a numbered list (1. 2. 3. 4. 5.)

Tech Stack: {tech_stack}
"""
```

### **Prompt Engineering Benefits**
- **Consistency**: Ensures exactly 5 questions every time
- **Relevance**: Focuses on candidate's declared skills
- **Priority**: Covers most important technologies first
- **Practicality**: Questions relate to real-world scenarios
- **Structure**: Numbered format for easy parsing

## ‚ö° Challenges & Solutions

### 1. **API Reliability**
- **Challenge**: Cohere API failures could break the application
- **Solution**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Implementation**: Try-catch blocks with graceful degradation

```python
try:
    response = co.generate(...)
    # Process response
except Exception as e:
    st.error("‚ö†Ô∏è Unable to generate questions now, please try later")
    # Offer retry option
```

### 2. **Question Parsing Consistency**
- **Challenge**: LLM responses can vary in format
- **Solution**: Robust regex parsing with fallback handling
- **Implementation**: Multiple parsing strategies and validation

### 3. **Conversation Flow Control**
- **Challenge**: Maintaining structured Q&A without free-form chat
- **Solution**: Session state management with strict progression logic
- **Implementation**: Sequential question presentation with validation
